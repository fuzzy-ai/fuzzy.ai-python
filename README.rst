Installation
------------

You can get this library by forking it from our Github repository::

    git clone https://github.com/fuzzy-ai/fuzzy.ai-python.git

After that, you can just use regular setup.py stuff to set it up.

Testing
-------

It uses pytest. However, you need to have a Fuzzy.ai API key to make it work.
You can get one by going to::

  https://fuzzy.ai/signup

The test script (not the SDK itself!) looks for the API key in the FUZZY_AI_KEY
environment variable. So you can run the test something like this::

  FUZZY_AI_KEY=<yourkeyhere> python -m pytest

Basic usage
-----------

When you use the fuzzyai module, you always have to provide your API key first.
Use the setup() function to do that::

  import fuzzyai

  fuzzyai.setup(YOUR_API_KEY)

To have a Fuzzy.ai agent make a decision for you, use the evaluate() function
of the fuzzyai module::

  from __future__ import print_function

  agent_id = "AGENTIDHERE"

  inputs = {
    "height": 188
    "weight": 88.7
  }

  outputs = fuzzyai.evaluate(agent_id, inputs)

  print outputs["run_distance"]

If you need to provide feedback on the evaluation, use the evaluate_with_id()
function to get an ID for the evaluation, and then provide that to the
feedback() function::

  agent_id = "AGENTIDHERE"

  inputs = {
    "height": 188
    "weight": 88.7
  }

  (outputs, evaluation_id) = fuzzyai.evaluate_with_id(agent_id, inputs)

  # Real-world usage of the run_distance will return some performance
  # metric.

  fuzzyai.feedback(evaluation_id, {"weight_loss": 0.25})

Advanced usage
--------------

All of the Fuzzy.ai API is available through this SDK.

The Agent class represents a single agent. It includes evaluate() and
evaluate_with_id() methods as well as save() and delete() to change the agent
on the server. Use that last part carefully!

The Evaluation class represents a single evaluation. It includes a get() method
to fetch details about the evaluation and the feedback() method to fetch
feedback on the evaluation.

The Feedback class represents a single feedback data point. It has a save()
method to generate feedback for an evaluation.
